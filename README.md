# Deforestacia
Deforestation platformer game, designed by Nyxxonial

How to play:
Press on the play button, and use the "A" and "D" Keys to move left and right. Use "Space" to jump.
The goal is to break the four trees left in the world, but doing so comes with a cost. Actions have consequences, afterall.

Jump between platforms to get around the levels. grey areas mean room transition and the green spaces indicate that you can jump multiple times off the surface, be it a ceiling or a platform to jump around.

Controls:
A - Move Left
D - Move Right
Space - Jump


Have fun!
